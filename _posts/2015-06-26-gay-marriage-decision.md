*Note: This is about addressing the concerns about the judiciary system, not political views.*

Today, June 26th, 2015, marks the day that the United States Supreme Court
ruled that  [gay marriage is legalnationwide](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/26/politics/supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling/index.html). 
As a resident of Massachusetts who shares the
state's primarily liberal and progressive ideals, I am happy to hear the news.
Of course there are many who disapprove of the decision (the decision itself
was close with a 5-4 majority). However **let us back away from the assumption
that those who disapprove are solely those who are against gay rights**. Looking at 
the front page of [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/), there
are several articles about the rational of some of the justices behind the
supreme court (SCOTUS) decision. Once you read the articles about those who
voted against the decision, a [potentially huge problem](http://www.businessinsider.com/scalia-gay-marriage-dissent-2015-6) reveals itself.

#It's About Judiciary Power

Among the justices who voted against the ruling, there are two common themes within their dissents:

1. The justices are unelected (They specifically use the number 5 to refer to the pro-gay-marriage justices)
2. The right to marry may or may not be theirs to judge because of point #1 and [THE CONSTITUTION](http://www.businessinsider.com/chief-justice-roberts-on-gay-marriage-ruling-just-who-do-we-think-we-are-2015-6)

The first point is important to remember since this means that the SCOTUS
technically doesn't represent the peoples' decision in an accurate way (that's
what the Senate and House of Representatives are for). Which is obviously the
first point that the opposition for any SCOTUS decision may bring up because
they can argue that it's easy for SCOTUS to not take into account the thoughts
of the entire nation. This is why many are outraged that SCOTUS could make
such a decision instead of the states or perhaps the legislative branch.

The Constitution (point #2) basically emphasizes the significance of point #1
because the Constitution states that the power belongs to the people. Once
again, because SCOTUS does not accurately represent the people, the opposition
is arguing that they should not have had the power to make any decision on
gay-marriage at all. Instead gay marriage should have been a policy dealt with
individually by the states. I am not well versed in the Constitution so I
won't try and explain further, but I want to leave you with some points
taken from the Business Insider articles I mention earlier.

[Chief Justice John Roberts writes](http://www.businessinsider.com/chief-justice-roberts-on-gay-marriage-ruling-just-who-do-we-think-we-are-2015-6#ixzz3eBqwFwoO):

>"Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my
 judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex
 couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that
 decision should rest with the people acting through their elected
 representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions
 authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution
 leaves no doubt about the answer.""

[Justice Antonin Scalia says](http://www.businessinsider.com/scalia-gay-marriage-dissent-2015-6):

>"This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine,
 always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs
 the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of
 Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern
 themselves."

and 

>"To allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and
 resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to
 violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without
 representation: no social transformation without representation"

[Justice Clarence Thomas also argues](http://www.businessinsider.com/clarence-thomas-dissent-gay-marriage-case-2015-6) 
that those petitioning for gay marriage were not deprived of their liberty. 
Furthermore, the pro-gay-marriage justices' decision for the sake of dignity is 
constitutionally unfounded since the government cannot grant or take away a peoples' 
dignity.

While I am happy for those who are positively affected by the SCOTUS decision
today, I wrote this to address those who may not quite understand the entire
situation behind the opposition.
