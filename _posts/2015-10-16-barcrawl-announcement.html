  This past summer I took an Algorithms class where we were required to utilize
  what we learned to code a final project. Myself and two others decided to
  implement a traveling salesman approximation in order to create a cool bar
  crawl across different bars across the country. We created a Python app that
  takes in a list of cities and uses the Yelp and Google Maps APIs to find the
  most popular bars in each city and look up the distances between each
  destination.

  When we submitted our project it was a simply Python console application
  consisting of 3 Python files. In an attempt to make our idea a little more
  relevant I have developed our original application into a full fledged web
  application powered by Django. I'm about 90% done with the deployment but I'm
  happy to say that there is now a web interface to our project!
