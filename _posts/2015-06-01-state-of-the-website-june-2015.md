*"State of the Website" is meant to summarize the progress that has been made in the development of this website and
 the work that is planned to continue its growth.*

## Progress Made

This website has been created with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and its release, marked by its first 
commit to GitHub, occurred four days ago on May 28th, 2015. The index page was initially created with GitHub's page 
generator using the "Slate" template. However the layout has since been replaced with custom content and only the 
"View on GitHub" banner and residual CSS were leftover (the CSS was left to ensure compatibility). [Jekyll]
(http://jekyllrb.com/), the static web page generator, was initialized in order to enable blogging features and the 
website has been structured accordingly. The layouts for the home page, the About Me page, and the blog page and 
posts were written by hand, with the design for the home page and the About Me page being taken from my other project
 [Chefversity](http://chefversity.com/).
