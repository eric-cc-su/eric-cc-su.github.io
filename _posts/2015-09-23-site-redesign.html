First of all I apologize for the lack of updates since July, I have been busy
 with summer classes, as well as some travelling. But now I'm back and I've
 decided to completely redesign the site to give it a simpler, cleaner feel.
 I felt as if the previous scrolling layout just wasn't giving me the minimal
  design that I was looking for. So instead I re-worked the entire landing
  page with a (hopefully) clean and simple design. Each link will pop up some
   information or route the user to the proper page or website. The desktop
   layout is completed, however there is still some work needed in responsive
    design so please stay tuned.
