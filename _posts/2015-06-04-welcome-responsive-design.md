As of June 4, 2015 the website was transferred to a responsive design that will allow mobile users to comfortably 
view and navigate the website on their devices without having to zoom in and out. This is a decision that was born 
from the industry necessity for websites to be mobile friendly in order to stay relevant and attract or keep users. 
Without a mobile friendly device, web pages are annoying to use for the millions of people who use their smartphones 
every day.

This website was originally built with the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) which is meant 
specifically for responsive design. At first commit, the Bootstrap framework had not been fully utilized, meaning 
that the previous designs were not mobile-friendly. However now, mobile users should be presented with a friendly 
toolbar and nicely formatted web content. 

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/mobile_nav.png" alt="responsive navbar" style="height: 400px">
</p>

Text should now be fit to the users screen so mobile users will not have to do any left-right scrolling 
while reading blog posts or information. In order to further improve the readability of blog posts for users, the 
navbar on all blog post pages will no longer remain at the top of the screen as the user scrolls (fixed-top) and 
will instead only remain at the top of the blog post (static-top) so mobile users will be able to enjoy more screen 
space to view blog content. 

The design will continue to be tweaked and updated as time goes while remaining responsive for mobile users.
