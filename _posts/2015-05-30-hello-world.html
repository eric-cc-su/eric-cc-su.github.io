    Hello World is the intro program that every beginner programmer writes to mark their adventure into the new world.
    This is my Hello World into the blogging world, the web development world and the world where I can be
    proactive about the things and ideas I wish to explore.

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    To begin, I am a computer engineering and computer science dual major at Northeastern University in Boston,
    Massachusetts. I'm currently in my second co-op (internship) thanks to Northeastern's co-op program that provides
    students the ability to work in full-time internships in between semesters of classes (more info here:
    <a href="http://www.northeastern.edu/coop/">Northeastern University Co-Op</a>). My current internship is as a
    Python/firmware programmer at <a href="https://www.emc.com/index.htm">EMC<sup>2</sup></a> where I have been working
    on scripting test cases and developing features to aid in
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzz testing</a>. My previous internship was at
    <a href="http://www.seagate.com/">Seagate</a> where I aided in running lab tests, before I switched over to web
    development for one of their proprietary web tools. I have these internships to thank for my experience in Python
    programming as Python is now my language of choice.
</p>
<p>
    Of course as a college student I have some free time and I need to be able to relieve stress from the coursework.
    I have been a member of the Northeastern University (Club) Triathlon Team since my freshman year and I currently
    serve on their executive board. I have raced about 3 triathlons a year and my practice schedule during the year
    ranges from 3 to 6 workouts a week depending on my classwork or co-op schedule. To contrast with my fitness crazed
    triathlon side I practice photography to bring out my creative side. I started with a used DSLR from eBay and I have
    moved onto a nicer, newer DSLR and more equipment that I'll carry around on city walks or wherever I travel.
    I lightly edit my photos and maintain a photography blog on Tumblr
    (<a href="http://suphotography.tumblr.com/">Eric Su Photography</a>) and all of my photos can be viewed on
    <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/sosu_me">Flickr</a>.

<h2>This Website</h2>
<p>
    To be able to say that I'm even somewhat interested in web development I feel as if having my own custom-made
    website is a must. This website was created as a project for myself to experiment in front-end web development and
    to start maintaining a blog to document all of my experiences in life. This website is also meant to serve up a
    (hopefully) less boring version of my resume details in case any potential employers decide to come poking around.
    Info on my education, work experience and projects is still in the works but I should be able to bring them online
    soon. The entire design and implementation of this site has been done myself, by hand, with credit given to any
    resources I have specified <a href="https://github.com/eric-cc-su/eric-cc-su.github.io">here</a>.
