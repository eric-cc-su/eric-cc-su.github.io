First of all, happy belated new year! Since my last post I've gone through my finals and I started
my new co-op at [Insurify](https://insurify.com/) as a software developer. Since Insurify is a 
startup, everyone has been working towards a public release that is happening by the end of this week!
I've jumped in the deep end and I've been developing features for their website non-stop but
it's great to finally be on a team that gets things done quickly. A perk of the team's small size is
that not only does my code get looked at faster, but that I have some degree of flexibility in 
figuring out some features' architecture and/or functionality. I will be trying to update
my blog with some stories and insights on the work I've been doing so far and lessons I've learned
along the way. Cheers!
