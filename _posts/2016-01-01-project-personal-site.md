This website was originally produced using the Jekyll static content generator and Liquid template engine
via GitHub Pages. The entire front-end was been written from scratch and a <a href="{{ site.url }}/jekyll-category-tag-automation/">developer-side
Ruby Jekyll plugin</a> was written to automate the implementation of tags and categories.
