As if I needed another article on why I'm so excited to be on a Mac now, here are my thoughts on why Microsoft 
screwed up so badly with Windows and how I moved on to buy a new Macbook running OS X. 

##Windows 7

Up until very recently, I have been a strong Windows and PC user. I built my own gaming desktop back in high school 
and of course that had to be a Windows system. My first laptop for college was a nice powerful Asus running Windows, 
which I still upgrade and use every day, and the computers I've used at work have all been PCs running Windows. The 
biggest thing that has kept me on board? The Windows 7 operating system.

Windows 7 was released in 2009 as the successor of the infamous Windows Vista. It was a great release with 
improvements in performance and new features, such as the oh-so-useful ability to split your screen with multiple 
application windows for multitasking. Most people agreed that Windows had done well to fix everything that made 
Windows Vista a big sore in the OS world. So I enjoyed several years of peace and happiness on Windows 7 with a desktop 
interface that was sensible and productive, until the Shangri-La of Windows 7 was disturbed by the news of Microsoft's 
new OS...Windows 8.

##How Windows Screwed Up Desktop

My absorption of news of Windows 8 goes as such: 

1. Microsoft announces Windows 8 with a whole new interface
2. Outrage. Microsoft and Windows are dead to me

Why the sudden and strong reaction to Windows 8? Microsoft decided, only 3 years after Windows 7 had been released, 
that the rise of mobile meant that everything should be immediately changed to be mobile-oriented...including the 
operating systems on desktops.

Microsoft calls the new layout "Metro", which makes the interface tile-based, with each 
tile representing an individual application. Now this layout no doubt makes sense on mobile devices, but on a desktop 
environment? I don't think so. The whole "Metro" conversion wouldn't have been such a terrible thing if Microsoft 
made it optional on the desktop OS. But instead, Microsoft completely threw out the desktop Start menu that users have 
depended on for years and booted up all devices to a screen of tiles. And as an ignorant compromise, they plopped the
 desktop environment on the home screen as another silly tile. So forget about desktop productivity with
  Windows 8, all Microsoft did was create an operating system for a market that they 
  [struggle](http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/18/technology/microsoft-earnings/) 
  [to achieve](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/19/microsoft-surface-rt-900-million_n_3624014.html) 
  [market share in](http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/windows-phone-users-are-jumping-ship-and-microsoft-needs-to-act-fast-1296086).

As a result of all this, I made a pact with myself to never allow Windows 8 into my computing sphere. Windows 8 had 
nothing exclusive to it compared to Windows 7, and after 3 years, Windows 7 was still very much alive as a leading 
operating system. So if I were to buy a new computer, I would either wait until Windows 8's successor came along or get
an entirely different operating system.

To be continued...
