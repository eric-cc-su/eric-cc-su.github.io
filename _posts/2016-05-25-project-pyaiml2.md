PyAiml is a Python interpreter for AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markup Language), which is used to
program chatbots and most famously known for making up
[A.L.I.C.E.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Linguistic_Internet_Computer_Entity), the natural language artificial intelligence chat robot.

PyAiml was written in Python 2 to interpret [AIML version 1.0.1](https://github.com/AIML-Foundation/AIML-1.0.1).
PyAiml2 is a fork of a Python 3 port of PyAiml with the objective to update
the intrepreter to handle
[AIML 2.0](https://github.com/AIML-Foundation/AIML-2.0-Spec/blob/master/aiml.md).
