*This is my response to the Wall Street Journal article 
**"Why Apple Should Kill Off the Mac"**
I encourage readers NOT to read the WSJ article as it will only boost the articles "popularity"*

DISCLAIMER: *I am not a professional developer...I just code enough to be pro-PC industry*

One of Wall Street Journal's tech columnists just wrote an article titled
 **Why Apple Should Kill Off the Mac**
 where he states his belief that Apple's Mac line (their computer/PC product line) is unnecessary and acts as a 
 distraction to Apple's business and innovation. Yes, this is another article that brings up the decline of the PC 
 industry and the prominence of mobile devices. However, this is also an article that talks specifically about Apple's 
 product line and speculates about its future as a tech company and I think the columnist has a dead wrong point of view 
 about the role of Macs, and of PCs in general, in today's world. 

##The Mac in Brief

Apple is well known for its innovative and sleek mobile products such as the iPhone, the new Watch, and the old iPods. 
With all the news around Apple's mobile products, it's easy for people to forget that Apple is an old company that
was founded to build personal computers. While their first product was a simple kit computer, Apple's has developed 
computers that have redefined affordability, user interaction, and design in both hardware and design. Today, Apple's 
Mac products are highly competitive against the PC competition thanks to its unique industry defining features such as 
 sleek aluminum bodies, fiercely useful touch-pads and peripherals, high quality screens, and amazing battery life 
 in its laptops. These features continue to define Macs as Apple's game changer to the industry, but the core computing
 function of Macs are what make them irreplaceable in today's digital world.

##The PC Industry

Let's sidestep for one minute and talk about the PC industry as a whole. It is true that PC sales are declining as more 
consumers are realizing they don't necessarily need a full fledged PC just to browse websites and watch Netflix. 
However, if any such consumers were to call for the end of the PC industry they would receive a very hard slap across
the face from me, followed by an hour long lecture about how PCs create the nice mobile world they enjoy so much.

My argument sums up to this: Computers can code, tablets and smartphones cannot. You cannot run web servers, code
compilers, or supercomputers with smartphones. With the rise of smart devices such as smart TVs and Nest's smart 
thermostat, it is necessary to remind the public that the software and/or firmware that runs these devices also need to 
be developed on a PC. Everything digital, from alarm clocks to automobiles, depends on software nowadays and computers
are needed to develop all of that software. 


##What Macs Bring to the Table

With my brief summary of the importance of the PC industry I am also implying that Macs, because they are also PCs, are 
important in continuing the development of today's modern systems. But then what about Macs specifically, compared to 
Windows or Linux based PCs, justify their existence? 

With Apple's form of tech isolation, **Macs are an absolute necessity for iPhone, iPad and Watch app development** and 
this is something that the WSJ columnist clearly hasn't thought about. Windows and Linux systems can develop for the
internet, for Android, and for basically everything else. However, Apple development is isolated to Macs
thanks to Apple's restriction of OS X, its development tools, and any language interpreters to Apple systems 
(Xcode, Swift, etc.) In addition, OS X's uniqueness in its interface, along with its UNIX base, makes the operating 
system a desirable choice for consumers and even developers. (More about this and how it relates to my recent 
Mac purchase [here]({% post_url 2015-06-12-os-x-upgrade-pt-2 %}))

##So Mr. Mims...

I believe that the opinion brought up by WSJ columnist Mims is completely ignorant of how tech works today. I don't know
what world he lives in, but computers are very much alive and necessary in reality. Software developers are among the 
most sought after employees and each of those software developers needs at least one computer, possibly more, and
 definitely a Mac if their company targets iOS or OS X. I suppose I should address the argument about Macs holding back
 Apple's innovation and I'll say this: 
 
 **No, Macs are not holding back Apple. Computers may not be the most glamorous thing anymore, but Apple 
 still defines the PC market and they need them to create the rest of their products.**
 
I would also like to address his statement "Is it really a good idea for Apple to continue to put resources against 
being king of a last-century technology?" with this:

**Personal computers are not "last-century technology", typewriters are.**

Personal computers still provide the basis for mobile computing technology and their endless functionality make them
a product capable of transcending multiple generations to come.
