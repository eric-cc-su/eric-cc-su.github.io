**UPDATE**: *According to [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/25/apple-bans-games-and-apps-featuring-the-confederate-flag/#.46jsai:U0R4), Apple has been working to reinstate apps that portray the Confederate flag in historical or educational manners.*

On Wednesday of last week, June 17th, nine people at the Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church In Charleston, South Carolina lost their lives to a
21 year old white male who opened fire inside the church in an apparent mass
shooting. It was found that the suspect had racist motives for the shooting and
was found in pictures with Confederate flags, indicating possible ties to a
radically conservative mindset. As a result of the shooting, many have called
for the removal of Confederate flags from
[landmarks](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/23/us/south-carolina-confederate-flag-dylann-roof.html) and
[sales](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/23/retailers-ban-confederate-flags_n_7648614.html) due to its ties to the Confederacy/secessionists of the American Civil War. I am not a history buff,
nor did I really retain my U.S. History knowledge from high school, so I won't
get into the history of the Civil War and the Union vs. the Confederacy, but you
should Google it if you have no idea what the Confederacy represented.

##In My Opinion

To cut to the chase: I believe that some people, companies, and even the government might need to
tone down the attack on the Confederacy for the sake of free speech and
historical legacy. The whole point of the United States of America, unless
there is some super-secret government dictatorship working behind the scenes
(please try not to get all conspiracy-theorist about that thought), is that
its people should have the right to freedom and equality in life. Although we may not like it,
freedom of speech should technically protect liberals, conservatives and everyone else so that they
may freely express their views and opinions. **A ban of the Confederate flag toes the line in the preservation of free speech because the flag represents the beliefs of that
group of people and aggressively insinuates that they are not welcome in this country.**

My personal and political views side on more modern views where I believe
slavery is abhorrent and racism is a form of raging ignorance. Although the
Confederacy  represented such horrible notions and wanted to secede from the
rest of the United States, it is still important that its history is not
ignored or pushed away. **It is true that the Confederacy should not be relevant
in modern society, but its  (bad) legacy should be remembered as a way for
the United States to look back on how it has grown.** In a worst case scenario
where we completely push away the Confederacy, there will come a time where
future generations don't know of the full history of the Civil War, slavery
and civil rights and society may start to regress. Preserving the history of
the Confederacy is the only way to stop such a thing from happening and to
make sure American society continues moving forward.

##This Is Where Apple Comes In...

It has been recently announced that
[Apple has pulled apps from the app store that contain the Confederate Flag](http://rt.com/usa/269779-apple-civil-war-games/).
While their reaction to the Charleston shooting certainly makes
sense, it also reeks of blunt force rather than thoughtful finesse. In the
case of HexWar, the developer of a Civil War game series, Apple notified the
developer that their game was pulled from the store due to its use of the
Confederate flag in "offensive and mean-spirited ways". Game Labs, another
Civil War game developer, had their game 'Ultimate General: Gettysburg' pulled
from the app store and both Game Labs and HexWar note that their games were
made for historical purposes and not to display the Confederate flag in a way
that promotes its views or offends individuals. While both developers have
accepted Apple's actions, HexWar has said that it will amend its game to use
a different variant of the Confederate flag while **Game Labs has declared
that it will not change the flags in its game for the sake of historical
accuracy** and their reaction is exactly how developers and history advocates
should respond. The RT article includes a lot more input from others but the
gist of the argument is that **Apple has overreacted and its actions are actually somewhat inappropriate
to those trying to portray American history**.

It is important that influential companies such as Apple help to progress
society not only with its products, but with its actions as well. Big tech
companies such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook (to name only a few)
now host a large portion of modern society's digital content and how they
manage the content within their servers is very important to its customers and
the digital world. Tech companies such as these have the power to build up, or
shut down, entire infrastructures and *"with great power comes great
responsibility"*. Apple needs to take more care in how it manages and controls
its content to address all of its customers throughout the country and the
world. **It makes sense to prohibit displays of inappropriate
content or views, but Apple stereotyped all Civil War apps and legitimate
products have been taken down as a result. In a country that promotes a
message of freedom and equality, stereotypes of any sort should not be
welcome.**

*TL;DR: Freedom of Speech is important. Teaching children about US History is
also important so society doesn't regress. Apple took an axe to all Civil War
apps, which is not the right way to address the Charleston shootings and the
Confederate flag*
