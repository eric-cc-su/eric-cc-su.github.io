Yesterday I wrote about [why the opposing justices on the Supreme Court voted against the decision to legalize gay marriage]({% post_url 2015-06-26-gay-marriage-decision %}).
If you read the article, it explains that the justices primarily opposed the
decision because they did not think that the Supreme Court should have the power
 to make a decision about marriage for the entire nation. There seems to be
 little or no indication that the opposing justices were opposed to the idea of
 gay marriage.

However, of course there were negative responses to the decision from more
conservative states, and among the opposition
[there was a lot of reference to the freedom of religion](http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-rules-for-nationwide-marriage-equality). To those people I say:

**The Supreme Court** ***DID NOT*** **take away your freedom of religion by
giving the LGBT community more equality.**

**They're not saying that you have to go and only marry gays and forget about
heterosexual couples.**

**They're saying that any and all bigots against the LGBT community no longer
have any legal power to stop gay marriage.**
