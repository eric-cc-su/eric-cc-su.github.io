Personal web page

The intention is for this web page to be a personal profile and blog. Created with Github Pages and using Jekyll.
Jekyll set-up is largely with tutorial: http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial

Some color pallettes/color inspiration used from [Google Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette)

The "View on Github" banner and some CSS has been taken and modified from the Github Pages "Slate" layout.
